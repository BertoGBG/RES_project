# RES_project
Renewable Energy System (RES) course project - Fall 2022 Semester Aarhus University.

The file [Instructions_RES_project](https://github.com/martavp/RES_project/blob/master/Instructions_RES_project.pdf) guides you through the installation of *Python for Power System Analysis* (PyPSA) which you will be using for your course project. Follow these instructions, and test if you have installed it correctly by running the Jupyter notebook [testing.ipynb](https://github.com/martavp/RES_project/blob/master/testing.ipynb). 

For the project instructions, see [RES_project.ipynb](https://github.com/martavp/RES_project/blob/master/RES_project.ipynb). Before you can run this, you need to download hourly capacity factors for [onshore wind](https://zenodo.org/record/3253876#.XSiVOEdS8l0) and [solar PV](https://zenodo.org/record/2613651#.XSiVOkdS8l0)  (select 'optimal' for PV and onshore for wind). Create a new folder in the root of this repository, name this new folder "data_extra" and move the .csv files with hourly capacity factors to here.

In the data folder, the electricity_demand and heating_demand data is provided in MWh.
